Exploratory Data Analysis of US Homelessness (2023) with visualizations and key insights

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of homelessness across U.S. states for the year 2023. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations to uncover patterns and key insights related to homelessness.

Objectives

- Load and inspect homelessness data by state and region  
- Clean the dataset and handle missing or inconsistent data  
- Calculate total homelessness and per capita homelessness rates  
- Visualize the distribution of homelessness across states and regions  
- Summarize key findings and insights from the data

- `homelessness_usa_2023_analysis.html`: Static HTML export of the notebook for easy viewing  
- `homelessness_in_US_2023.csv`: The original dataset with state-level homelessness data

Key Findings

- California has the highest homeless population by a wide margin  
- Western states show higher homelessness rates per capita  
- Some smaller states, such as Alaska and Hawaii, have disproportionately high rates relative to population  
- Data quality is good, with minimal cleaning required
